# JYM1 Task 1 Class Roster

## C867 Scripting and Programming - Applications

Western Governors University
Welcome to the repository for the C867 Scripting and Programming - Applications project at Western Governors University. This project involves creating a C++ application for managing a student roster. The application will be developed based on the provided requirements and data.

### Project Overview

In this project, you will be tasked with building a C++ application to assist a university in migrating its student system to a new platform. The existing system's requirements are already defined, and your role is to implement a portion of the system as per these requirements. The application will manage a roster of students enrolled in a specific course, maintaining their essential data, such as student ID, names, email addresses, ages, course completion durations, and degree programs.

### Student Data

To work with the student data, you will use the following table as a reference:

### Key Requirements

Modify the "studentData Table" to include your personal information as the last item.
Create a C++ project in your integrated development environment (IDE) with specific source code files.
Define an enumerated data type DegreeProgram for the degree programs (SECURITY, NETWORK, SOFTWARE).
Implement the Student class with variables and functions as specified.
Implement the Roster class with functions for adding, removing, and printing student information.
Demonstrate the program's functionality in the main() function by creating a classRoster instance, adding students, and performing various operations on the roster.
