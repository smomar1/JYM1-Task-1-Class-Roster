# JYM1 Task 1 Class Roster

## C867 Scripting and Programming - Applications

Western Governors University
Welcome to the repository for the C867 Scripting and Programming - Applications project at Western Governors University. This project involves creating a C++ application for managing a student roster. The application will be developed based on the provided requirements and data.

### Project Overview

In this project, you will be tasked with building a C++ application to assist a university in migrating its student system to a new platform. The existing system's requirements are already defined, and your role is to implement a portion of the system as per these requirements. The application will manage a roster of students enrolled in a specific course, maintaining their essential data, such as student ID, names, email addresses, ages, course completion durations, and degree programs.

### Student Data

To work with the student data, you will use the following table as a reference:

Student ID	First Name	Last Name	Email	Age	Days in Course	Degree Program
A1	John	Smith	John1989@gm ail.com	20	30, 35, 40	SECURITY
A2	Suzan	Erickson	Erickson_1990@gmailcom	19	50, 30, 40	NETWORK
A3	Jack	Napoli	The_lawyer99yahoo.com	19	20, 40, 33	SOFTWARE
A4	Erin	Black	Erin.black@comcast.net	22	50, 58, 40	SECURITY
A5	[Your First Name]	[Your Last Name]	[Your Email Address]	[Your Age]	[Your Course Durations]	SOFTWARE

### Key Requirements

Modify the "studentData Table" to include your personal information as the last item.
Create a C++ project in your integrated development environment (IDE) with specific source code files.
Define an enumerated data type DegreeProgram for the degree programs (SECURITY, NETWORK, SOFTWARE).
Implement the Student class with variables and functions as specified.
Implement the Roster class with functions for adding, removing, and printing student information.
Demonstrate the program's functionality in the main() function by creating a classRoster instance, adding students, and performing various operations on the roster.
